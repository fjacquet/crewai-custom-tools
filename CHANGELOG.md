# Changelog

All notable changes to the `crewai-custom-tools` project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Unified Caching Layer (`config/cache.py`)**:
  - Structured, thread-safe, self-healing file and memory cache using `.crewai_cache/`.
  - Added `@cache_api_call` decorator to easily apply caching to core sync functions.
  - Implemented SHA-256 and MD5 cryptographic hashing to ensure completely deterministic key generation across restarts (avoiding built-in randomized `hash()`).
  - Added dynamic class instance `self` inspection to strip memory addresses (like `0x...`), preventing cache misses when instance methods are decorated.
  - Robust `FileNotFoundError` and `JSONDecodeError` safety to handle concurrent race conditions.
- **Unified Tool Set (`tools/`)**:
  - `PerplexitySearchTool` (in `tools/web/perplexity.py`) featuring standard requests timeouts, dual-return formats (`"json"` or `"markdown"`), and multi-environmental api-key validation.
  - `YahooFinanceNewsTool` (in `tools/finance/yfinance_news.py`) returning structured news data for financial instruments, wrapped with safety borders.
  - `YahooFinanceTickerInfoTool` (in `tools/finance/yfinance_ticker.py`) extracting a standardized, clean metric subset (P/E ratio, Market Cap, Beta) for assets, ETFs, and cryptos.
- **Top-Level Exports**: Exposes `PerplexitySearchTool`, `YahooFinanceTickerInfoTool`, and `YahooFinanceNewsTool` directly from `crewai_custom_tools`.
- **Comprehensive Pytest Suite**: 40 unit and integration tests covering versions, caching layers, filename collision, metadata preservation, wraps decorator, error responses, and mock APIs.

### Changed

- **Modular Packaging**: Renamed library package from `crewai-tools` to `crewai-custom-tools` to prevent PyPI conflicts, updating all workspace files and plan structures.
- **Extracted Optional Extras**: Isolated `yfinance` under `[finance]` extra and `pytest-mock` under `[dev]` extra inside `pyproject.toml` to minimize base deployment size.
- **Standard Logging**: Swapped all custom logger formats (Loguru bracket syntax `{}`) to standard Python `logging` for lightweight compatibility.
- **Failure Non-Caching Policy**: Refactored financial news fetching to ensure exception payloads and rate limits are never cached permanently, allowing immediate recovery on subsequent execution.
